In this example we use DecisionTree and RandomForest classifiers to predict what kind of Forest Covering will grow in an area. Is it driven by elevation of the land, soil type or distance from the source of water? Find out using Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Snowpark. This is a relatively larger data set with 581K rows and 54 features.

Added a second notebook with an approach to batch feeds into the classification model to parallelize scoring.
