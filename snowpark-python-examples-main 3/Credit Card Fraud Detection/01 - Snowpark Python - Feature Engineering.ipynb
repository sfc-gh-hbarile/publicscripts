    "The main goal with the Terminal ID transformations will be to extract a risk score, that assesses the exposure of a given terminal ID to fraudulent transactions. The risk score will be defined as the average number of fraudulent transactions that occurred on a terminal ID over a time window. As for customer ID transformations, we will use three window sizes, of 1, 7, and 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to customer ID transformations, the time windows will not directly precede a given transaction. Instead, they will be shifted back by a delay period. The delay period accounts for the fact that, in practice, the fraudulent transactions are only discovered after a fraud investigation or a customer complaint. Hence, the fraudulent labels, which are needed to compute the risk score, are only available after this delay period. To a first approximation, this delay period will be set to one week.\n",
